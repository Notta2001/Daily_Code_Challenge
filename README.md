# Daily_Code_Challenge

That challenge requires participants to tackle at least one problem / day in leetcode (you can visit the website here: https://leetcode.com/) So I can say that it demonstrates the journey and how I learn to code in the daily grind. You can try it if you want and make it turn into one of your habits. I bet that you will see your day-by-day progress.
And feel free when contacting me and we can do the challenge together. Hope to see you.
